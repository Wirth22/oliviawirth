Hi! I am a PhD candidate in Development Economics at the [University of Passau](https://www.wiwi.uni-passau.de/en/development-economics). I do research in development and political economy using causal inference and randomized field experiments in East and West Africa.
In my dissertation, I explore the role of digital technologies in advancing development in sub-Saharan Africa.

During Fall 2024, I was a visiting PhD student at [The Fletcher School at Tufts University](https://fletcher.tufts.edu/), invited by [Jenny C. Aker](https://sites.tufts.edu/jennyaker/).
I hold an MSc in Economics from the [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU)](https://www.econ.lmu.de/en/) and have worked as a research assistant at the [ifo Institute – Leibniz Institute for Economic Research](https://www.ifo.de/en/ifo-homepage).

If you’re interested in my research or would like to connect, feel free to reach out — I’m always happy to exchange ideas!
